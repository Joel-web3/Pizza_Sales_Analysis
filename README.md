## Introduction
This project represents a meticulous exploration of sales data from a pizza store, aiming to uncover insights that drive its commercial performance. 
Using a combination of Excel & SQL for data extraction and manipulation, coupled with the robust visualization capabilities of Power BI, this analysis presents findings that range from revenue calculations to sales distribution across pizza categories.

## Problem Statement
- **Total Revenue**: The sum total of all pizza orders.
  
- **Average Order Value**: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
  
- **Total Pizzas Sold**: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
  
- **Total Orders**: The sum total of all orders.
  
- **Average Pizzas Per Order**: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by total number of orders.

## Charts Requirements

- **Daily Trend for Total Orders**: A bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help me identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.
  
- **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**: A line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will help me identify peak hours or periods of high-order activity.
  
- **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: A pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
  
- **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**: A pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help me understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.
  
- **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**: A funnel chart that represents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will help me compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.
  
- **Top 5 Best-Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders**: A bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders. This chart will help me identify the most popular pizza options.
  
- **Bottom 5 Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders**: A bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders. This chart will help me identify the less popular pizza options.

## Key Insights From the Data Analytics

üìÖ There's an influx of customers on Fridays and Saturdays. So allocating more resources such as staff and inventory to match anticipated demands on these days will help improve service delivery and increase sales.

üçï The Classic category, especially the Classic Deluxe Pizza, is already a hit amongst customers. Hence, augmenting marketing efforts around the Classic Deluxe Pizza with highlighted promotions and creative bundles will further enhance its visibility and increase sales.

ü•á With a pronounced preference for large-size pizzas, one can introduce attractive upselling (or upsizing) offers and combo deals that incentivize choosing large pizzas.

üèÜ As the Thai Chicken Pizza is a significant revenue generator, one can explore price elasticity to find the optimal price point that maximizes revenue without deterring buyers.

üêå Finally, the underperformance of Brie Carre Pizza presents an opportunity for a strategic revamp, either through marketing efforts, pricing adjustments, or a customer survey that can foster product modification. I‚Äôm a staunch advocate for robust two-way communication channels because, when done right, can lead to enhanced customer satisfaction and retention.
